Data Validation & Encoding:

2: Valid, DB can produce an error and error handling is not done
3: Valid, application just passes UUIDs to the DB without Validation
4: Valid, application just passes UUIDs to the DB without Validation
5: N/A, there are no encoding routines, everything is text
6: N/A, there are no encoding routines, everything is text
7: N/A, there is no input validation, everything is text
8: N/A, no sanitization required
9: Valid, no validation happens
10: Valid, no input validation happens
J: Valid, no input validation happens
Q: N/A, no writes happen
K: Valid, sqli
A: Valid, in operation there is no logging, therefore you can't detect attacks against input validation

Authentication:
2: Valid, the api tokens are hardcoded and static
3: Valid, there is no encryption and tokens are static
4: N/A, there are only tokens
5: Valid, the api tokens are static
6: Valid, static api tokens
7: Valid, static api tokens
8: Invalid, api tokens required 
9: N/A, no critical actions applicable
10: Valid, static tokens
J: Invalid, tokens are required
Q: Invalid, auth is required always
K: Invalid, auth is always required
A: Valid, we will never detect a misused token, no logging

Session Management:
2: Invalid, there are no session ids generated
3: Valid, tokens are static and only token validity is checked
4: Invalid, no cookies being generated
5: Invalid, no cookies being generated
6: Valid, tokens are static
7: Valid, tokens are static
8: Valid, tokens are static
9: Valid, no TLS in play
10: Invalid, no stat-changing requests in scope
J: Valid, no uniqueness in requests
Q: Invalid, tokens are checked always
K: Valid, self-build session management controls
A: Valid, there is no logging, we would never be able to detect new attacks

Authorization:
2: Invalid, db connection string static
3: Valid, only UUID is checked and not token-uuid combo, also sqli
4: Valid, no authz happens
5: N/A, there in a single request, no other requests in scope
6: Valid, sqli, db as root
7: Valid, sqli, db as root
8: Valid, sqli db as root
9: Invalid, no race condition I'm aware off
10: Invalid, tokens always checked
J: Invalid, tokens stored in memory, no memory access we know off
Q: SQLI -> command injection potentially possible
K: SQLI -> command injection potentially possible
A: Valid, no logging we would never see This

Cryptography:
2: N/A : there is no encryption nor obfuscation
3: N/A : there is no encryption
4: N/A : no channels are encrypted
5: N/A : no crypto controls exist
6: Valid, data in transit are plain text
7: Valid, data in transit are plain text
8: Valid, DB not encrypted
9: N/A : no random number generation exists
10: N/A : no crypto in use 
J: Valid : Hardcoded DB string
Q: N/A : no master crypto secrets
K: N/A : no crypto in use
A: N/A : no crypto in use

Cornucopia:
2: Valid, sqli
3: N/A: no client side binaries
4: Valid, no logging 
5: ??
6: Valid, e.g. sqli but also no other error handling
7: Valid, no logging
8: Valid, infra is fire and forget
9: N/A : no admin interface
10: Valid, vulnerable dependency in requirements
J: Valid, the application does not come with ops details
Q: Valid, no logging
K: Valid, sqli can empty the db
A: Valid, no logging
